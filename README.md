# What I Learned In Week 1

## Basics of logical thinking/flowcharts

I learned about thinking logically. This included:

* Using flowcharts to plan out a process from beginning to end, including actions and decisions
* Using Human Resources Machine (HRM) to practice figuring out the steps needed to complete a task, and the order in which to perform each step

I had trouble with some of the logic puzzles in class due to overthinking or missing a clue. I did better in HRM.

## bash wildcard

I learned how to use the wildcard `*` in bash to manipulate multiple files at once without typing complete filenames.
This is very helpful to move, copy, remove every one of a particular file type.

---

## HTML

I learned about HTML and how to use tags to format text and other items in more elaborate ways than can be done using markdown. 

I was able to easily convert my previous markdown portfolio to a matching html site. However, when it came to improving on the original site, I needed to research and use some CSS in order to make the site look the way I wanted.

I learned how to use anchor `<a>` tags to link to other websites, and to other pages on my own site.

## Visual Studio Code (VSC)

I was able to practice with, and improve my skills with VSC. 

I learned how important it is to pay attention to which file you are working on (which directory it is in/if it is a copy). I found myself working on a duplicate file in another directory once, and didn't understand why my changes were not being seen by Git.

## Git and Github

I was able to improve on using Git in general, though I did still run into a few issues.

I learned how important it is to be in the right directory when cloning a repository.

## Time 

I learned that sometimes (at least at this point) assignments can take much longer than I thought they would. Issues arise, my brain freezes, further research is required. I also learned I enjoy every minute of it, especially the "aha" moments.
